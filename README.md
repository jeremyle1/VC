### Gameplay
- Cards are placed face up in the middle of the table when played.
- Player turns go counter-clockwise.
- Player with the 3 of spades takes the first turn.
- After a player has made a move, the next player must beat the current card or combination, or pass their turn.
If a player passes their turn, they cannot play again until somebody has played a card/combination that no one else can beat.
- The first player to run out of cards wins.

### Legal Moves

- **Four of a kind**: four cards of the same rank e.g. 5 spades, 5 clubs, 5 diamonds, 5 hearts
  - can beat any single 2.
- **Straight**: three or more cards where each subsequent card is one rank greater than the previous<br/>
e.g. 7 spades, 8 diamonds, 9 spades, 10 hearts, J diamonds
  - a 2 cannot be part of a straight. For example, K spades, A clubs, 2 spades would not be a legal move.
- **Double Straight**: a straight of pairs where each subsequent pair is one rank larger than the previous.<br/>
e.g. 10, 10, J, J, Q, Q, K, K
  - a double straight of three pairs can beat any single 2.
